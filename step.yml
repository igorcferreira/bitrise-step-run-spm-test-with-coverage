  Run Swift Test With Code Coverage
summary: |
  Step that runs SPM tests on macOS, outputting an XML/HTML test result file and Code Coverage JSON file
description: |
  This step uses xcodebuild & xcpretty to run the macOS tests for the Swift Package Manager. The final files are
  output in a structure compatible with the "Test Report" plugin and can be configured to be JUnit or HTML as output,
  so the generated files are compatible with tools like Danger.
  The Code coverage is always exported as a JSON file.

# If this step should be available only for certain project types
# just uncomment this `project_type_tags` section and include all the
# project types supported by the step. If the step can be used for all
# project types then you can just remove this section.
# If no `project_type_tags` specified (or specified as an empty array)
# that means the step can be used for any project type.
# You can find more information about project type tags in the Step Development Guideline:
# https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/blob/master/_docs/step-development-guideline.md

project_type_tags:
  - macos
#   - android

# Type tags are used for categorizing steps, for easier step discovery in Step Libraries.
